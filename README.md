py-libykneo
===========

The purpose of this project is to extract libykneo from the code at [Yubico/yubioath-desktop](https://github.com/Yubico/yubioath-desktop) and attempt to make it into a mildly reusable set of code.

Motivation
----------

I couldn't find any references to this library being usable as a standalone thing to start with.
